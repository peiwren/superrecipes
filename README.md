### `Flow`
The user views the app with a browser.
The front end communicates with the Express back end via RESTful APIs.
The back-end Express application uses the Mongo database for storing and retrieving data.
Back-end results are communicated back to the front end.
Front-end results are rendered in a human-readable format to the user.
